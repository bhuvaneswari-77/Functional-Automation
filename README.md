# Functional Automation Repository

Welcome to the Functional Automation Repository for Software Engineering!

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to helping you master Functional Automation in software engineering. We focus on industry-standard techniques and strategies, including:

- **Page Object Model (POM):** A design pattern that promotes code maintainability and reusability by encapsulating web page elements and their interactions.

- **Modular Driven Framework:** A structured approach to automation where functionalities are broken down into smaller, modular components for ease of development and maintenance.

- **Data Driven Approach:** Enhance your automation tests by separating test data from test scripts, making your tests more versatile and scalable.

- **Dynamic XPath Strategy:** Learn how to efficiently locate elements using dynamic XPath expressions, ensuring robust automation scripts even when page structures change.

## Contents

- ðŸ“‚ **POM**: Explore a comprehensive set of examples and best practices for implementing the Page Object Model in your automation projects.

- ðŸ“¦ **Modular Driven Framework**: Discover how to build modular, reusable automation components that can be easily integrated into your test suites.

- ðŸ“Š **Data Driven Approach**: Dive into the world of data-driven testing, enabling your automation to handle various test scenarios and datasets.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Dynamic XPath Strategy**: Master the art of crafting dynamic XPath expressions to locate web elements intelligently and adapt to changes.
